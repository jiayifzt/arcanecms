Who are you?

What is this?
    ArcaneCMS is a content management system written in PHP. It's a rewrite of 
    my former, personal content management system. ArcaneCMS is designed to be 
    lightweight, simple to implement into existing designs and site, and almost
    invisible to the visitor (unlike certain CMSs *cough*JoomlaAndDrupal*cough*).

Why?!?
    Because I can :)

How do I use it?
    Short Answer: You can't (yet).
    Long Answer: You can, but I haven't really gotten far enough to make it
		 convenient for you. There's no installer, there's no admin
		 interface (yet). There's also no documentation. I will not
		 help you implement it because its not supposed to be 
		 implemented at this stage. It's pretty simple though and 
		 you should be able to figure it out if you dig through the
		 code and the included database file that sets up tables.

Will you add <insert feature here>?
    Very possibly. If you make a good case for it or it's something that belongs
    in a content management system, I'll put it on my todo list.

How can I help?
