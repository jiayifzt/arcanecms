Who are you?
	http://www.maxfierke.com/about
	
What is this?
	ArcaneCMS is a content management system written in PHP. It's a rewrite of
	my former personal content management system. ArcaneCMS is designed to be
	lightweight, simple to implement into existing designs and sites, and almost
	invisible to the visitor (unlike certain CMSs *cough*JoomlaAndDrupal*cough*).
	ArcaneCMS runs on the Simple PHP Framework. More details in LICENSE.

Why?!?
	Because I can :)

How do I use it?
	Short Answer: 	You can't (yet).
	Long Answer:  	You can, but I haven't really gotten far enough to make it
					convenient for you. There's no installer, there's no admin
					interface (yet). There's also no documentation. It's simple
					enough that you should be able to figure it out if you dig
					through the code and the included database file.
					
What are the requirements?
	PHP 5+
	SQL server (MySQL only at the moment, but I'm planning on switching to PDO)
	A webserver with rewrite functionality (I officially support Apache and nginx)

Where/How can I use this?
	See LICENSE

Will you add <insert feature here>?
	Very possibly. If you make a good case for it or it's something that belongs
	in a content management system, I'll put it on my todo list.

How can I help?
	1) Email me at max@maxfierke.com
	2) Fork it and if I like your changes, I'll merge 'em.
