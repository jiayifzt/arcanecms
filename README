Who are you?
	http://www.maxfierke.com/about
	
What is this?
    ArcaneCMS is a content management system written in PHP. It's a rewrite of 
	my former, personal content management system. ArcaneCMS is designed to be 
	lightweight, simple to implement into existing designs and site, and almost
	invisible to the vistor (unlike certain CMSs *cough*JoomlaAndDrupal*cough*).

Why?!?
    Because I can :)

How do I use it?
    Short Answer: You can't.
	Long Answer: You can, but I haven't really gotten far enough to make it
				 convenient for you. There's no installer, there's no admin
				 interface (yet). There's also no documentation. I will not
				 help you implement it because its not supposed to be 
				 implemented at this stage.

Will you add <insert feature here>?
    Definitely maybe. If you make a good case for it, I'll put it on my todo
	list.

How can I help?
    1) Email me at max@maxfierke.com
	2) Fork it and if I like your changes, I'll merge 'em.
