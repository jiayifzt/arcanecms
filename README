Who are you?
	http://www.maxfierke.com/about
	
What is this?
	ArcaneCMS is a content management system written in PHP. It's a rewrite of 
	my former personal content management system. ArcaneCMS is designed to be 
	lightweight, simple to implement into existing designs and sites, and almost
	invisible to the visitor (unlike certain CMSs *cough*JoomlaAndDrupal*cough*).
	ArcaneCMS runs on a modified version of the Simple PHP Framework. 
	More details in LICENSE.

Why?!?
	Because I can :)

How do I use it?
	Short Answer: 	You can't (yet).
	Long Answer: 	You can, but I haven't really gotten far enough to make it
			convenient for you. There's no installer, there's no admin
			interface (yet). There's minimal documentation. It's simple 
			enough that you should be able to figure it out if you dig 
			through the code and the included database file.
What are the requirements?
	PHP 5.3 with PDO (Installed by default) (5.2 may work, but I won't support it)
	SQL server (MySQL and SQLite are implemented and officially supported. Postgre 
			support will be added soon. Any PDO supported database should
			work, but you need to add it yourself. Look at the Database
			class (class.database.php) in the includes directory)
	A webserver with rewrite functionality (I officially support Apache and nginx)
	See INSTALL

Where/How can I use this?
	See LICENSE

Will you add <insert feature here>?
	Very possibly. If you make a good case for it or it's something that belongs
	in a content management system, I'll put it on my todo list.

How can I help?
	1) Email me at max@maxfierke.com
	2) Design a theme for inclusion in every installation of Arcane. 
		(Just create a single page and a CSS stylesheet and any images needed, 
		I will convert it for use in Arcane and maintain it. You will get a 
		"Designed by <Yourname>" and a link back to your site). The theme will
		need to be licensed under a license compatible with the Apache License
		version 2.0.
	3) Submit feature requests, bug reports, etc. at: 
		https://groups.google.com/group/arcanecms/
	4) Fork it, submit a pull request and if I like your changes, I'll merge 'em.
